# NotYourAverageBookies

## Description

We designed a website for all the readers of the world to spend less time searching for a book and more time reading. We asked ourselves, what is the hardest part about reading? To us, it seemed the biggest issue was a lack of good book recommendations. We also figured that making it easier to browse books based off a specific genre would further reduce time spent searching to maximize time reading.

Overall, this project allows a user to login, so they can use the complete functionality of the website, and browse without signing in. Once a user logs in, we then grant them the ability to create a personal reading list. We added the layer of security to prevent malicious use of the website. Furthermore, the website offers recommendations of books to read and allows the user to browse based off genres.

## Usage

A user can access the site without logging in, but they get more from the website when they do. If a user doesn't login, they're first highly rated books that are randomly selected to display on the homepage. The user can also access lists of books based off genres by clicking a genre on the left hand side. The user who doesn't login will only use the website to look for inspiration on what to read next. The use who logs in can take it one step further by saving books to a personal reading list. Once the user logs-in by adding their email and a secure password, they're able to save books. For each book, we provide the following information:

- Title
- Author
- Genre
- Cover image
- Description
